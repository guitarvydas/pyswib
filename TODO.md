- [ ] 3. pattern match and rewrite DPL .drawio file to JSON

wip:
- sampler.lisp = mock-up of bytecode
- moved to t2t
  - t2t working on small example
  - TODO: convert sampler.lisp -> sampler.json
  - TODO: write vm (interpreter) for sampler.json
- abandoned: sampler.pycode - stream of line-oriented instructions, moved to attic
- abandoned: lisp2py.ohm - grammar to recognize lisp, intended to convert to py, subsumed by t2t, moved to attic
- abandoned: sampler.bytecode - line-oriented instructions that specify op+control-flow on every line, subsumed by t2t / lisp / rt version, moved to attic
- abandoned: sampler.py - early attempt to define vm
- abandoned: sampler.script - early attempt to define script syntax, moved to attic
